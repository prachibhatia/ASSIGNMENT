**Employee Management System**

This is a employee management system using MERN stack.

It has a Login and Register authentication functionality and on successfully logging in the user will be directed to a employee detail form wherin he/she can fill his complete details. After filling the details he will be directed to a page where all registered employees information are there .
Complete front end is made using react.js and backened using Node.js/Express.js.I have also used MongoDb for saving user data.
